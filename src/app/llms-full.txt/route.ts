## Product status

${siteConfig.name} is a pre-launch seismic monitoring product. It is not yet generally available, and no public retail price or general-availability date has been published. Pilot participation is the current public path for organizations and building owners.

## What the device does

The wall-mounted device measures three-axis building motion during shaking, stores an event recording, and can notify a paired phone when configured thresholds are crossed. The recording is intended to help a qualified engineer review what happened after an earthquake. The device does not certify that a building is safe and is not a substitute for a structural inspection.

## How measurement and reporting work

- The device observes vibration continuously and distinguishes sustained shaking from short local disturbances.
- Event data is buffered locally so a recording can survive a temporary internet interruption.
- Confirmed recordings can be summarized with common earthquake-engineering measurements such as peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity.
- Longer-term structural-health indicators are informational signals for professional review, not automatic safety decisions.

## Intended audiences

- Residents and small-building owners who want a record of how their building moved.
- Building managers running multi-device pilots.
- Campuses, factories, municipalities, and research teams evaluating building-level monitoring.
- Engineers who may review exported event information after an earthquake.

## Installation and connectivity

The current product concept uses wall mounting, USB-C power, and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. Installation details, network requirements, and pilot support are described on the product and pilot pages.

## Privacy and consent

The public website uses consent-controlled analytics. Form submissions are validated and forwarded through server-side endpoints. Product and pilot data handling is described in the privacy and security pages. ${siteConfig.name} does not claim to sell personal data.

## Important limits

- Earthquake warning time can be very short or nonexistent for nearby events.
- A device cannot declare a building safe or unsafe.
- Public product specifications may change before general availability.
- Pricing, ratings, certifications, and shipping dates should not be inferred when they are not explicitly published.
