# Repository governance and release control

## Operating model

GitHub is the repository's sole source-control and automation control plane. Repository rulesets, protected environments, status checks, security scanning, review requirements, and deployment approvals must be configured and reviewed in GitHub.

## Production-only model

The repository and hosting model are production-only. There is no staging workflow, environment, credential, Passenger mount, release root, DNS entry, or deployment pipeline. Changes are validated through pull-request CI, browser/accessibility tests, build and standalone smoke tests, read-only production audits, and guarded production validation before activation.

## Normal change flow

1. Create a focused branch from current `main`.
2. Open a pull request and complete the pull-request template.
3. Wait for all required GitHub Actions and security checks.
4. Review the diff, bot and agent comments, dependency feedback, and operational impact.
5. Resolve every blocking conversation and failed check.
6. Merge with **Squash and merge** and delete the merged branch.
7. Confirm the `Mainline Policy` workflow associates the new `main` commit with a merged pull request.

## Production release gate

Production never deploys automatically from a push. `Deploy Production` is manual-only. A guarded operation must:

- run from `main`;
- provide the exact current `main` SHA;
- use the documented operation confirmation phrase;
- pass the GitHub production environment approval;
- use the scoped private-key credential or the explicitly configured password fallback;
- preserve transactional activation and automatic rollback.

## Secret isolation

Production deployment credentials are scoped to the GitHub production environment and the approved Doppler configuration. The complete private key is stored as one protected secret and injected only into the job that requires it. Read-only audit credentials must not be reused for deployment mutations. Secret values must never be logged, copied into issues, or committed.

## Required checks

A normal pull request must have successful GitHub evidence for lint, typecheck, tests, production build, browser/accessibility, commit policy, dependency audit, secret scanning, and code scanning. If required GitHub execution capacity is unavailable, the pull request remains blocked; another platform is not accepted as replacement evidence.

## Emergency hotfix

The preferred emergency path remains a focused branch and pull request. A direct push is reserved for a GitHub control-plane outage where delaying the fix creates greater production risk. Record the incident, run every available local quality check, use the exact `main` SHA, verify rollback readiness, and open a follow-up pull request containing the final evidence.

## Access and recovery continuity

At least two trusted organization owners or repository administrators should exist, each with independent MFA and recovery material. The current single administrator condition remains a continuity risk until a second trusted administrator is verified. Review administrator access, Actions permissions, environment reviewers, GitHub Apps, webhooks, runners, deploy keys, and recovery ownership quarterly and after personnel or provider changes.

## Related controls

- Maintenance roles, secret rotation, incident response, and archive retention are defined in `maintenance-ownership.md`.
- High-impact technical and product wording is governed by `../governance/technical-claims-register.md`.
- Historical audit snapshots under `../archive/` describe past state and must not be treated as current operational truth without revalidation.
