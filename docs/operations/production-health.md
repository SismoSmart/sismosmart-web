# Production health monitoring

## Purpose and safety boundary

The `Production Health` GitHub Actions workflow is a scheduled, read-only audit of the live service. It runs at minute 17 every six hours and can also be dispatched manually. It does not deploy, restart Passenger, reconcile release pointers, delete releases, submit forms, alter DNS, purge caches, or change hosting configuration.

The audit uses the production SSH and cPanel credentials only to read state. Its JSON artifact is retained for 14 days. Artifact upload is deliberately non-blocking so an Actions storage incident cannot hide the actual audit result.

## What is checked

The audit records:

- DNS resolution timing for the canonical hostname;
- cold and warm HTTPS timing at the Cloudflare edge;
- direct-origin HTTPS timing while preserving the canonical Host header and TLS SNI;
- `/`, `/en`, `/tr`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/site.webmanifest`, `/api/contact`, and `/api/waitlist` behavior;
- agreement between the `current` symlink, Passenger app root, `PassengerAppRoot` in `.htaccess`, a running `next-server` process working directory, and the active `.next/BUILD_ID`;
- retained release count and storage, filesystem use, account quota when available, and cPanel LVE resource usage when exposed by the provider;
- aggregate HTTP status classes for the two form APIs from a bounded access-log tail;
- the latest completed Deploy Production, Security, and Lighthouse workflow conclusions.

## Privacy model

Monitoring does not collect form payloads or other personal data. Access logs are reduced on the hosting account to route and HTTP status before any output leaves the host. The report excludes IP addresses, origin addresses, raw log lines, query strings, cookies, authorization headers, referrers, user agents, endpoint secrets, SSH hostnames, and credentials.

Do not modify the audit to upload raw access logs. A form incident that requires request-level diagnosis must use the approved provider log process with a defined retention period and access control.

## Thresholds

Latency reflects a shared hosting environment and is warning-only. Lighthouse remains the browser-performance gate.

| Signal | Warning | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public warm TTFB | above 1,500 ms | only when the route or expected status fails |
| Origin warm TTFB | above 1,200 ms | only when the route or expected status fails |
| Filesystem usage | 85% or higher | 95% or higher |
| Account quota usage | 80% or higher | 90% or higher |
| Retained release count | more than 8 | more than 12 |
| Release storage | more than 1 GiB | more than 2 GiB |
| Form API server errors | any sampled `5xx` | five or more `5xx` responses and at least 20% of sampled form API requests |
| Deploy, Security, or Lighthouse history | latest completed run failed once | two consecutive completed runs failed |

A missing optional quota, LVE, or access-log measurement produces a warning rather than a false outage. Missing release-state inspection is blocking because consistency cannot be proved safely.

## Fault domains

The report contains one primary `classification`. Investigate in this order:

### `release-state`

One or more deployment invariants disagree or cannot be inspected. Compare `current`, Passenger, `.htaccess`, process cwd, and `BUILD_ID`. Do not run a new deploy until the desired active release is independently established. Use the reconciliation and manual recovery procedures in the production deployment runbook.

### `dns`

The canonical hostname could not be resolved. Check registrar delegation, Cloudflare zone status, authoritative nameservers, and the DNS Cutover workflow before examining Passenger.

### `cloudflare-edge`

The direct origin is healthy but the public route is not. Review Cloudflare DNS, proxy status, TLS mode, WAF/rate-limit events, cache behavior, and edge incidents. Do not change origin application state merely because the edge probe failed.

### `origin-passenger`

The origin probe is unhealthy, or both public and origin probes fail. Inspect Passenger registration, the active process, runtime logs, hosting resource pressure, TLS at the origin, and release consistency. A DNS-successful public failure with an unhealthy origin belongs here rather than at Cloudflare.

### `application-form-runtime`

Pages are available but a form status endpoint is not configured/healthy, or the sampled form API `5xx` threshold is crossed. Check canonical server-only runtime variables and the controlled forms verification operation. Never paste endpoint values or form records into an issue.

### `capacity`

Filesystem, account quota, retained release count, or release storage crossed a blocking threshold. Review the exact measurements, run retention in dry-run mode, and remove only entries selected by the protected release planner. For account or filesystem constraints outside the account boundary, escalate to the hosting provider.

### `github-actions`

At least one target workflow has two consecutive completed failures. Open both runs, identify the first failed job/step, and distinguish a repository defect from GitHub-hosted runner, artifact, or external provider failure before rerunning.

`healthy-with-warnings` means no blocking fault was found, but latency, optional telemetry, a single workflow failure, form `5xx`, or approaching capacity requires review. `healthy` means all required checks passed with no warnings.

## Manual dispatch and report review

1. Open Actions → Production Health → Run workflow.
2. Use the current reviewed branch or `main`; do not add mutation inputs.
3. Review the job summary before downloading the JSON artifact.
4. Confirm `classification`, `blocking`, `warnings`, release mismatches, route status/timing, capacity severities, form aggregates, and workflow streaks.
5. Treat a missing report as a workflow/runtime error, not as a healthy result.

The JSON report uses schema version 1 and intentionally contains stable route labels instead of raw URLs or infrastructure addresses.

If the Actions artifact quota prevents upload, use the compact `PRODUCTION_HEALTH_SAFE` line in the audit step log. It preserves classification, failed route keys with status/error metadata, release mismatch names, capacity severities and values, aggregate form counts, workflow streaks, and warnings without infrastructure paths or credentials. An artifact quota failure remains non-blocking; the audit exit code is still authoritative.

## Hosting constraints and escalation

The application runs under cPanel/CloudLinux Passenger on shared infrastructure. Host-wide load averages, disk pressure, noisy-neighbor effects, and provider throttling can affect TTFB even when repository code is unchanged. The audit records cPanel quota and LVE CPU/I/O/resource usage when the provider module returns them; it does not invent an LVE ceiling when the API omits one.

Escalate to the hosting provider when any of the following persists after a warm rerun:

- origin warm TTFB remains above 1,200 ms while application and release state are healthy;
- filesystem or account quota approaches the blocking threshold and cannot be corrected by reviewed release retention;
- LVE CPU, memory, entry-process, process-count, or I/O usage repeatedly reaches the provider maximum;
- Passenger becomes unavailable despite a consistent release and valid runtime configuration;
- origin TLS or provider networking fails independently of Cloudflare.

Include UTC timestamps, workflow run IDs, route labels, cold/warm timing, quota percentages, LVE usage versus maximum, and the report classification. Do not include IP addresses, credentials, endpoint secrets, raw logs, or form data.

## Alert channel

The scheduled workflow result is the alert. GitHub notifications should be enabled for failed Actions runs. The workflow does not automatically create or reopen issues, because repeated transient provider failures should be reviewed before generating repository noise. Two consecutive completed failures are blocking and must be triaged under the fault domain reported by the latest audit.
