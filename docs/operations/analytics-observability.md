# Analytics and consent observability

## Scope

This runbook covers the production GA4, Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Clarity, Search Console, consent, and form-success event configuration for `sismosmart.com`.

## Canonical configuration

Public resource identifiers are not credentials. Their canonical source is `config/analytics.json` and matching GitHub repository variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID`
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_WEB_STREAM_ID`
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_SITE`
- `CLARITY_PROJECT_ID`

Environment values may override the committed public configuration for diagnostics. `npm run ops:status` reports the source of each value without printing unredacted identifiers.

Production and CI explicitly set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`. The project has no staging target, so only production and local test traffic are relevant.

## Secret credentials

The following remain GitHub secrets or local uncommitted environment values:

- Google OAuth client secret
- Google OAuth refresh token
- service-account JSON or key path
- Measurement Protocol API secret
- Clarity export token

Use read-only Google scopes for routine status and audit operations. Edit or publish scopes are only appropriate for an explicit administrative operation. Rotate OAuth client secrets and refresh tokens after suspected exposure, operator removal, or at least annually. Revoke the old token only after the replacement passes `ops:ga`, `ops:gtm`, and `ops:search-console` status checks.

## Tag ownership

GTM owns the primary production loading path for GA4 and Clarity. The application loads the GTM container only after analytics consent. Direct `gtag.js` and direct Clarity loading are fallback paths used only when GTM is not configured.

This avoids duplicate GA configuration and duplicate `page_view` events.

## Consent model

Before any analytics loader is inserted, the application initializes Google consent with all storage categories denied. The banner supports:

- `accepted`: Google consent is granted, Clarity ConsentV2 is granted, and analytics loaders may start.
- `necessary`: Google and Clarity analytics consent remain denied and no analytics loaders start.
- reset: stored consent is removed, Google and Clarity are returned to denied, Clarity first-party cookies are cleared, and the banner is shown again.

The six supported locales are `en`, `tr`, `es`, `id`, `pt`, and `it`.

## Events

Successful JSON form submissions emit one consent-aware event:

- event: `sismosmart_form_success`
- `form_type`: `contact`, `waitlist`, or `pilot_program`
- `locale`: active document locale
- `page_path`: current path

No event is emitted when analytics consent is absent or denied. The server-side form delivery result remains the source of truth; analytics is only emitted after a successful HTTP response.

## Automated checks

Run:

```bash
npm run ops:status
npm run ops:analytics-admin-audit -- --output-dir .artifacts/analytics
npm run ops:ga -- status
npm run ops:gtm -- status
npm run ops:search-console -- status
npm run ops:clarity -- status
npm run ops:analytics-audit -- --base-url https://sismosmart.com --output .artifacts/analytics-observability.json
```

The `Analytics Observability` GitHub workflow runs manually, weekly, and after a successful production deployment. It:

1. validates GA4, GTM, Search Console, and Clarity resource access;
2. checks all six locales with a real Chrome browser;
3. confirms no analytics requests before consent or under necessary-only consent;
4. confirms one GTM loader, no duplicate GA loader, exactly one GA page view, and one Clarity loader after acceptance;
5. verifies the consent command ordering, reset behavior, and form-success event;
6. uploads a redacted JSON artifact.

Browser reports contain request classes and event names only. They do not store client IDs, cookie values, OAuth tokens, or complete request URLs.

### Administrative credential degradation

The browser consent and network audit is the production hard gate. Google Admin API access is a separate control-plane check:

- an expired, revoked, or missing Google credential is recorded as `auth-degraded`; the administrative audit fails while the browser audit still runs and uploads its evidence;
- successful authentication followed by a GA4, GTM, or Search Console resource mismatch remains a hard failure;
- the workflow uploads `admin-audit.json` even when a later step fails;
- credential rotation is tracked in issue #81 and must never place refresh-token values in logs or artifacts.

This distinction prevents a stale operator credential from hiding real production consent regressions while preserving visibility of the credential defect.

## Controlled GA4 verification

The browser audit sends `sismosmart_analytics_audit` with `form_type=observability_audit`. Confirm the request in the audit artifact and, when needed, verify it in GA4 DebugView or Realtime. Realtime ingestion can lag; absence from the API immediately after a network-level success is not treated as proof of delivery failure.

## GTM preview and Clarity verification

For a manual release review:

1. Open GTM Preview for `https://sismosmart.com/en`.
2. Verify no GA4 or Clarity tags fire before consent.
3. Select **Accept** and verify the GA4 configuration and Clarity tags fire once.
4. Trigger a controlled form success and verify one `sismosmart_form_success` data-layer event.
5. Open Clarity and confirm a consented session is received.
6. Reset consent and verify subsequent analytics collection is denied.

## Missing configuration versus no traffic

`ops:status` distinguishes:

- identifier configured versus missing;
- committed config versus environment override;
- OAuth/service-account readiness;
- Clarity export-token readiness;
- analytics activation enabled versus default-disabled.

A configured resource with an empty Realtime report means no recent traffic or delayed ingestion; it does not mean the resource is missing.

## Rollback

If analytics or consent behavior regresses:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false` for the affected build and redeploy. This removes the consent component and all application-controlled analytics loaders.
2. Disable the affected tag in GTM if the defect is container-side.
3. Roll back the production release through the transactional deploy workflow if the defect is application-side.
4. Restore the previous `config/analytics.json` and workflow variable mapping through a reviewed PR.
5. Re-run `Analytics Observability` before re-enabling analytics.
